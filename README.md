Blood Stream successfully delivers a web-based backend application that reflects the real-world application of backend development principles such as RESTful routing, middleware integration, user authentication, dynamic data processing, and MongoDB-based storage. The system provides secure interfaces for managing blood donors, handling hospital requests, and maintaining up-to-date blood inventory records. Each component of the application—be it user registration, donor validation, or inventory tracking—is powered by backend logic that ensures data integrity, efficiency, and seamless communication between the server and database. The backend was tested thoroughly in a development environment to validate all functional requirements. The API endpoints were evaluated using tools like Postman and browser-based interactions. The system also successfully handled various error conditions such as invalid requests, expired tokens, or unavailable data by rendering user-friendly error messages or returning appropriate HTTP status codes. The final system is a fully operational blood bank management application developed using a MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) with EJS as the templating engine for optional server-rendered views. It integrates seamlessly with MongoDB for document-based storage, and the entire server architecture is driven by RESTful APIs and protected by secure authentication layers. The system supports: I. Donor Registration and login: Secure donor sign-up and login using hashed passwords and JWT-based session handling. Authenticated users are redirected to their dashboard. II. Role-Based Access and Authorization: Admin-only routes are protected using custom middleware. Hospital staff and donors see different interfaces and data based on their role. III. Blood Inventory Management: Admins can add, update, or remove blood units, with the ability to view current stock and flag critical shortages. IV. Request Handling: Hospitals can request specific blood types, and the system automatically matches them with available units or eligible donors. V. MongoDB Data Persistence: All user data, blood records, requests, and donation logs are stored in MongoDB using Mongoose schemas and validated fields. VI. Dashboard and Analytics (Admin):Admins are presented with real-time stats about donors, active requests, available inventory, and upcoming donation events. VII. Organized Backend Structure: The project follows a modular design with distinct directories for models, controllers, routes, middleware, and configurations. Each module operates independently, enabling maintainability and future scalability. VIII. Error Handling and User Feedback: Custom 404 and 500 error handlers are implemented to guide users gracefully in case of missing routes or internal server failures. The backend was tested in a local Node.js environment on port 3000, with MongoDB Atlas serving as the primary database. The system demonstrated high reliability in request processing, accuracy in matching logic, and flexibility for future enhancements. for my project
